			<h1>
				AIM of Knowledge Hub
			</h1>
			<p>
				The main aim of the project is to provide users an application which can be used
				to share different projects and categorize them into user defined domains.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h2>
				Why Knowledge Hub?
			</h2>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Many projects are completed in every Engineer’s life or in the life of
						person belonging to any discipline.But what is the use of making a good project without atleast sharing it or
						atleast it’s minimum contents.  We all know that Github is emerging and quite useful. But the projects
						uploaded in github are numerous in number and many of them may not be working. And the project which we upload is categorized by Github. We don’t have a free will to choose the domain to which particular project is uploaded. In order to overcome the present scenario, KNOWLEDGE HUB is used.
					</li>
					<li class="hello">
						User’s can choose their own platform while uploading a project , incase if
						the platform is not existing, they can create their own one’s. This gives
						advantage to other users to easily sort out and find the project according
						to their own requirements. 
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		
			<h2>
				Motivation
			</h2>
			<p>
				The main feature where our KMS is superior to existing systems is giving
				free will to it’s users.
				GitHub the largest sharing platform is lagging in only one point i.e the users cannot categorize their own projects into their domains.
				Whereas our system gives an opportunity for the users to categorize the domains of the projects.
				Which means users are at their free will of their use.
